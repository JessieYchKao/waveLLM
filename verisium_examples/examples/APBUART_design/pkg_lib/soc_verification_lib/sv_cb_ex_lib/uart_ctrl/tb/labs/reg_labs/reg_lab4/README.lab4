UVM REG PACKAGE - March-2012

LAB 4 - ADDING THE REGISTER COMPONENTS IN THE VERIFICATION ENVIRONMENT
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
For this lab, you will be hooking up the register components in the
uart_ctrl design from our SOC Verification Kit.

Objectives:
  o Review the transaction adapter and register model
  o Hook up the required components in the testbench
  o Handling reset

Before starting this lab - remember to source the setup.csh file

FIRST:
Work in the $MY_WORK_AREA/reg_lab4 directory.
   % cd  $SOCV_KIT_HOME/soc_verification_lib/sv_cb_ex_lib/uart_ctrl/sv

  o  Review the uart_ctrl_regs.sv file in this directory. It contains the
     register definitions for this lab. It should be similar to the file
     you generated in lab1.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Hook up the predictor in the testbench
   (NOTE: Search for UVM_REG and LAB4 in your lab database files)

  o Edit the uart_ctrl_tb.sv and uart_ctrl_env.sv file in this directory.
    Declare the predictor (uvm_reg_predictor#(apb_transfer) apb_predictor)

    In the build_phase() method, 
    Build the predictor: apb_predictor

    In the connect_phase() method, 
    Connect the register model and transaction adapter (reg2apb) to predictor.
    Connect the analysis port from APB monitor to TLM port of predictor. 
    This is how predictor get all the transactions.

At this point - you should be able to use the Makefile to compile/elaborate and simulate the testbench with registers included.  

The default test in the Makefile should be executed:

    % $SOCV_KIT_HOME/soc_verification_lib/sv_cb_ex_lib/uart_ctrl/tb/scripts/run.sh  

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Good Luck!
